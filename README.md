# 👋 Hi there, I’m @pabloarancibia!

### 🚀 Senior Software Engineer | Cloud Architect | R&D Engineer

Versatile **Senior Software Engineer** with over 10 years of experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance distributed systems. My background spans **Cloud Architecture**, **Microservices**, and **AI Engineering**, with a strong focus on engineering rigor, security, and maintainability.

I specialize in bridging the gap between complex business requirements and robust technical solutions, whether in **AI-driven applications**, **high-volume transactional systems**, or **cloud-native infrastructure**. I am currently exploring advanced R&D in **Generative AI Agents** and **Vector Search**, applying the same engineering principles that I use for mission-critical backend systems.
